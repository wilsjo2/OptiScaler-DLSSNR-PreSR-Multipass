// Neural Rendering through the driver's own nvngx.dll, instead of through a forwarder.
//
// The forwarder exists for one reason: the model resolves its caller's return address to a module
// and refuses anything whose path does not contain "nvngx.dll". Driving the model directly means
// satisfying that check, which means shipping a small DLL named to satisfy it, which means the
// model's own NGX entry points are called by us rather than by the runtime that was meant to call
// them.
//
// But the model ships inside the driver store, and NVIDIA does not ship a feature DLL that no
// dispatcher can reach. A probe settled it: asking the driver's nvngx.dll to create feature 18
// returns FAIL_UnableToInitializeFeature, while asking for a feature that does not exist returns
// FAIL_OutOfDate. Different answers to different ids means the dispatcher knows this one -- it found
// the feature and failed to start it on the empty parameter block the probe deliberately passed.
//
// OptiScaler already tells the driver where to look. NVNGX_FeatureInfo_Paths carries the executable
// folder and OptiScaler's own folder into Init_Ext, which is exactly the mechanism that finds
// nvngx_dlss.dll and friends. Nothing new is needed to locate the model.
//
// What this path gains, beyond deleting the forwarder:
//
//   * The SDK's typed setters. The slot hunting in the forwarder (floats at vtable slot 6, not the
//     header's 1) was a consequence of driving the model's own block by hand. A block from the
//     driver is an ordinary NGX parameter block.
//   * No anti-tail-call trick, because there is no caller check to satisfy.
//
// Off by default until it has been shown to produce the same picture as the forwarder path.
