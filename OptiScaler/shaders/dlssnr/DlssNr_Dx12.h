// The composition pass for Neural Rendering.
//
// Neural Rendering is two things, and only one of them is a shader. The model is an NGX feature --
// created and evaluated, not dispatched -- and that stays where it is. This is the other half: the
// pass that builds the tone-mapped proxy the model is shown, and then transfers the model's answer
// back onto the real frame.
//
// It is an ordinary compute shader with a constant struct, so it belongs here alongside RCAS and
// Output Scaling rather than owning a bespoke root signature and descriptor ring of its own.
//
// One shader, three modes, because all three read and write the same set of resources and differ
// only in what they compute:
//
//   Encode   the frame -> a tone-mapped proxy, plus an untouched copy to transfer against later
//   Down     the proxy -> a smaller proxy, when the model is asked to work below full resolution
//   Resolve  proxy + model answer + untouched copy -> the frame, edited
