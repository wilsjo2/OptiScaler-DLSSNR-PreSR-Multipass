// Bringing an impossible colour back into a possible one.
//
// A colour with a negative component is not a colour any display can show, and the composition can
// produce one: the model's answer is rescaled by a ratio and its chroma rebuilt, and either step can
// push a saturated pixel past the edge of the gamut.
//
// This used to be a hard clamp -- convert to AP1, max() every channel against zero, convert back --
// which is a per-channel operation on exactly the pixels most likely to breach, and per-channel
// operations on saturated pixels are the hue distorter this file warns about everywhere else. The
// channel that hits the wall first decides the colour of the rest.
//
// Instead the whole colour is scaled toward the neutral axis by one factor, so its hue survives and
// only its saturation gives way. And it is exactly nothing when nothing is out of gamut: with every
// component non-negative the scale is 1 and the colour comes back bit-for-bit.
